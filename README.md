## Team Members: Aditya P, Dibyendu Mishra, Sanchit Bansal, Vinayak Agarwal. 

#### Project Description : Our aim is to create a smart reply system to the bulk of emails that we keep receiving everyday. The objective is to be able to compute simple basic emails so that we can actually devote a majority of time to actually work on problems that matter. We are looking at a Stage 1 demo right now, where a basic framework will accept a test email and display a rough response. 

#### Resources : Python, Weka , Microsoft Excel , CSS , HTML5
